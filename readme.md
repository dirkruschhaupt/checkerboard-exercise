**The Rules**

Your `index.html` must look like this:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Checkerboard</title>
</head>
<body>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

You are not allowed to add any other elements to the html file, which means that you must create all the tiles dynamically.  Same goes for CSS: no CSS in the html file or in a separate stylesheet.  You must set all the style properties using Javascript.
